That's a smart approach to planning your access control! Here is the prompt to implement the categorized sales history and the new Admin/Manager Portal, including the sensitive data points we've discussed.

🔑 React POS System: Sales Categorization & Admin Portal Prompt
Building upon the existing features, implement daily categorization for Sales History and create a dedicated Admin/Manager Portal for restricted views.

🎯 Feature Requirements:
Sales History Categorization:

Update the Sales History page (/dashboard/sales).

The displayed sales records must now be grouped or divided by the Date of the transaction.

Each daily grouping should display a Daily Sales Total (sum of all transactions for that day).

The overall page should still show the comprehensive list, just organized by date.

2. Admin/Manager Portal Setup (Access All Sensitive Views):
Create a new parent route, Admin Portal (/dashboard/admin).

This portal should have its own navigation (or use the main sidebar) to access the following sensitive sections.

Crucially, all the views listed below must be accessible without any login logic for now, as requested.

Admin-Only Views:
Page Name	Route	Purpose & Content
View All Employees	/dashboard/admin/employees	This is the same page as before, but the route is moved here to signify it's an Admin-Only function. It should display the table of employee names and roles.
Stock Details & Reorder	/dashboard/admin/stock	A detailed view of the current stock for all products. It must clearly display the Product Name, Current Quantity, and a calculated column for Reorder Status (e.g., "OK", "Low", "Critical").
Profit/Revenue Summary	/dashboard/admin/financials	A placeholder page dedicated to financial reporting. It should display large, placeholder figures for: Total Revenue, Total Sales Count, and Average Transaction Value.
System Settings	/dashboard/admin/settings	A placeholder page for future system configurations, such as setting the accent color or changing application name. It should have a basic form layout.

Export to Sheets

✨ Styling & Consistency:
Maintain the existing React/JavaScript/Tailwind CSS stack and the accent color #FF6347.

The Admin Portal views should have a clear visual indicator (e.g., a colored heading or banner) using Tailwind CSS to signify they are restricted areas.

💡 What You Are Missing (Access Control Logic)
For future reference, once the frontend is complete, the logic you will need to implement to make these views truly restricted is:

Authentication State: A global state variable (managed by Context or Zustand) that stores the currently logged-in user's role (e.g., 'admin', 'manager', or 'employee').

Route Protection: Use React Router DOM's capabilities (like a higher-order component or custom routes) to check the user's role before rendering a component. If the role does not match the required access level, the user is redirected to the sign-in page or an "Access Denied" page.

UI Hiding: Dynamically hide the links to /dashboard/admin and its sub-pages from the main navigation/sidebar for any user whose role is not admin or manager.
